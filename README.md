   - **ForkCopy.c** - Implements file copying using the `fork()` system call.
   - **PipeCopy.c** - Implements file copying using inter-process communication (pipes).
4. **Shell/**

   - **MergesortMulti.c** - Implements a multi-threaded merge sort algorithm. 

## How to Compile
Run the following command in the project directory:
```sh
make
```
This will generate all executable files in the `Prj1` directory.

## How to Clean
To remove all compiled executables, run:
```sh
make clean
```

## Notes
- Ensure you have `gcc` installed to compile the files.
- The executables will have the same names as their corresponding source files but without the `.c` extension.
